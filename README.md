# Node Red flows
From this [post](https://www.pg540.org/wiki/index.php/RFE_for_PlutoDVB2)

This repository focuses on **TX flows**

## Motivation
Opening and closing batch scripts can be very time consuming.

This repository is my amalgamation of these two things with the focus on the TX front-end

The first commit of this post is ​DATV-NotSoEasy V1.0 as provided from Michael's post

From here I will commit my changes so they can be tracked

## ffmpeg, Linux-version, Mosquitto and MPV directories ignored


Please use **SET-FAVORITE.bat** to setup profiles 1-5 and rename Node-RED buttons accrodingly

Mine is setup as 125, 250, 333, 500 and 1000KS
